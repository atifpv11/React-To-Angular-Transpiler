# Candidate Task: React-to-Angular Transpiler

## Objective
Build a Python script that converts a React component into an Angular component.

### What You Have:
- A sample React component (`TodoList.jsx`).
- A reference Angular component structure.
- A starter Python script (`transpiler.py`).

### What You Need to Do:
- Parse the React component.
- Generate Angular component files:
  - `TodoList.component.ts`
  - `TodoList.component.html`
- Document your approach in a README.

### Notes:
- Focus on mapping JSX to Angular template syntax.
- Map React state/props to Angular bindings.
- Even partial solutions are acceptable if you explain your approach.

### Level 2 (Interview):
- Extend your transpiler to handle hooks or nested components.
